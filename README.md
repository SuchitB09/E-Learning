E-Learning Platform

--Overview

  This project is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) built with React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL as the database. It is designed to streamline online learning by providing tools for course management, assessments, student progress tracking, certification, and more — all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
